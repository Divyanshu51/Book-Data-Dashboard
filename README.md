# 📚 Book-Data-Dashboard | Power BI
This project utilises Power BI to explore and analyse a large dataset of books. The main goal was to clean the data, extract useful insights, and create a dashboard 
that highlights key information like publication trends, ratings, and top-performing books and authors.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
I performed all the data cleaning directly in Power BI using the Query Editor. 
Key steps:
- Removed errors and null values from columns
- Fixed inconsistent or incorrect date formats
- Created new columns for `Year`, `Month`, and `Date` to help with time-based filtering
- Cleaned and standardised columns like `Binding Type`, `Authors`, and `Genres`
